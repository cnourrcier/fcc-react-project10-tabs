# Tabs

This project is a React-based tab component system that allows for dynamic and interactive content display through tabbed navigation. The implementation includes a parent component, TabParent, which defines an array of tabs, each with a label and associated content. The content for each tab can include standard HTML elements or custom React components, providing flexibility for diverse use cases.

Key features:

- Dynamic Tab Content: Each tab's content can be easily customized, including the use of custom components such as RandomComponent.

- State Management: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the active tab state, ensuring a responsive and interactive user experience.

- Event Handling: Includes a callback function, handleChange, which logs the current tab index to the console whenever a tab is switched, demonstrating how to handle tab change events for further customization or analytics.
